test ES parser for ES 2.1.1 (can't ensure it would work in ES 1.x or 2.2.x or upper)
just to implement Lucene Surround Query Parser.

basic way to do the thing like reinstall.sh.
take care of the path.

also, if your ES version is not 2.1.1 or jave version is different, 
change the thing in pom.xml.

also change the thing in src/main/resources/plugin-descriptor.properties.

java version must be something like 1.7.0 not 1.7.0_111.

I would try to do this install more normally in the future.
